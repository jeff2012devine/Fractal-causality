## Plain-Language Introduction

Fractal Causality is a hypothesis that the universe carries a hidden rhythm — a repeating log-periodic
pattern — that shows up across very different scales of reality. From the clustering of galaxies, to the
hum of gravitational waves and atomic clocks, to predictive signals in the human brain, the idea is
that one underlying “oscillator” leaves its fingerprints everywhere.

Fractal Causality v3.2 formalizes this idea into a testable framework with precise equations,
falsifiability criteria, and reproducibility protocols. This release includes:

- **Plain-language Readme** (accessible intro)
- **Core Thesis** (cosmic time, CQBs, involuntary loop, autonomy ladder)
- **Technical Supplement** (math pack, Bayesian criteria, ISS proofs, governance, reproducibility)
