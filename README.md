## Overview  

This repository contains the official materials for **Fractal Causality (FC)** â€” a cosmological framework that challenges and extends the standard Big Bang model.  

At the heart of FC is the **Law of Expansion (LOE)**, which acts as a universal conveyor belt of existence, continuously driven by **Continuous Quantum Bursts (CQBs)** and powered by the cyclical recycling role of black holes.  

Together, these elements form a **closed-circuit system** â€” a fractal architecture of infinite loops of creation, transformation, and renewal.
