## ðŸ“– Overview

**Fractal Causality (FC)** is a falsifiable cosmological model describing how our 3+1 universe emerges from a hidden 5th dimension we call the **Law of Expansion (LOE)**.  

Within LOE, localized **Cosmic Quantum Bursts (CQBs)** continuously project the structure of reality. These bursts generate recursive interference patterns that appear as measurable signatures across cosmological datasets and precision experiments.

## âœ¨ Why it matters

- FC proposes **clear, testable predictions**:
  - Interference beats in the matter power spectrum *P(k)*
  - Log-periodic echoes in *ln(k)*
  - Phase coherence in the bispectrum
  - Possible correlated signals in optical clock networks

- The framework is compact, falsifiable, and open to independent verification.
