This repository contains the materials for **Fractal Causality (FC)**, a cosmological framework defined by the **Law of Expansion (LOE)** and driven by **Continuous Quantum Bursts (CQBs)** within the 5th dimensional Big Bang field.  

- ðŸ“„ **Conceptual Model (v1.2)** â€“ Framework description, six-bubble system, black-hole intake.  
- ðŸ“„ **Mathematical Skeleton (v1.3)** â€“ Preliminary formalization: 5D burst field, continuity equation, circuit closure, entropy filtration.
