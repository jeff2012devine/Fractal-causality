# fractal causality v3.3

**author:** j.m. devine  
**doi:** 10.5281/zenodo.17148490

## overview
fractal causality proposes that black holes are not endpoints but transformation chambers where information undergoes a **loop‑quantum bounce** and **conformal flip**, re‑seeding new expansions.  
this framework unifies lqc, holography, and conformal cosmology into a fractal loop that is both mathematically rigorous and philosophically resonant.

## what’s new in v3.3
- full **mathematical framework**: bounce dynamics, conformal rescaling, perturbation equations  
- **testable predictions**: cmb, lss, gw, and 21cm signatures  
- **stability analysis**: ghost‑free, causal, and perturbatively consistent bounces  
- **falsification criteria**: clear decision points that rule in/out the model  
- **references**: canonical literature for lqc, ccc, holography, planck, surveys  

## positioning
traditional pipelines are clogged for independent voices. this release embraces an **unorthodox method**: human intuition + ai derivation + open access.  
the result is not a plea for attention but a **framework** ready for scrutiny.
